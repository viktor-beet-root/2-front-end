                                company based out of Berlin, currently operated by Siesly and her sister Ashely. They
                                needed help for a big rebrand and wanted to relaunch their website.</p>
                            <p class="hero-block__text">Their goals were simple, create a unique e-commerce store that
                                bring a wonderful shopping experience at every stage of the buyer’s journey.</p>

                                off the Myers Briggs personality test. According to the Myers Briggs, there are 16
                                potential user personality types. Our template integrates questions from this online
                                personality test example into a series of sliding bar graphics. If you’re confused as to
                                what the sliders mean, check out the Myers Briggs basics article. </p>

                            <p class="article-block__text">I list out a jumble of words and draw tiny sketches related
                                to what I’m working on (and find the parallels later). Personally, I prefer paper with a
                                grid so I can convey things responsively. Most of the time perfection isn’t an issue and
                                the sketches are just for me.</p>

                            <p class="article-block__text">I played with adding a wireframe of the website flow that
                                would lead you in to each screen. For each of those screens I added a floating footer
                                that allows users to see where they are in that particular flow and jump around as
                                needed.” We’re digging this InVision-made wireframe.</p>
