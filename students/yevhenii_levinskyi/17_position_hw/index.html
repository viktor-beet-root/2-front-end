                    <p class="text">Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for
                        environment
                        setup instructions, they've moved to <span class="span">their own section</span>. Continue
                        reading for
                        an introduction to the documentation, Native Components, React, and more!</p>
                    <h2 class="h2" id="core_components">Core Components</h2>
                    <p class="text">React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications
                        using
                        React and the app platform’s native capabilities. With React Native, you use JavaScript to
                        access your
                        platform’s APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React
                        components:
                        bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more about React in the next section. But
                        first, let’s
                        cover how components work in React Native.</p>
                    <h2 class="h2" id="react_fundamentals">React Fundamentals</h2>
                    <p class="text">React Native runs on <span class="span">React</span>, a popular open source library
                        for
                        buildings user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to
                        understand
                        React itself. This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.</p>

                        </li>
                        <li class="main_list_item"><span class="main_list-text">components.</span> The rest of this
                            introduction to React uses cats in its
                            examples:
                            friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</li>
                        <li class="main_list_item"><span class="main_list-text">JSX.</span> React and React Native use
                            JSX, a syntax that lets you write
                            elements
                            inside JavaScript like so: &lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;Text&gt;. The React docs
                            have <span class="span">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can refer to learn even
                            more. Because JSX
                            is
                            JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat,
                            name, and
                            embedding it with curly braces inside &lt;Text&gt;.</li>
                        <li class="main_list_item"><span class="main_list-text">props.</span> Props is short for
                            “properties”.</li>
                        <li class="main_list_item"><span class="main_list-text">state.</span> While you can think of
                            props as arguments you use to
                            configure how
                            components render, state is like a component’s personal data storage. State is useful for
                            handling
                            data
                            that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components
                            memory!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 class="h2" id="handling">Handling Text Input</h2>
                    <p class="text">TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an
                        onChangeText
                        prop
                        that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that
                        takes a
                        function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>
                    <p class="text">For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a
                        different
                        language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: &#127829;. So the
                        sentence
                        "Hello
                        there Bob" would be translated as "&#127829;&#127829;&#127829;".</p>
