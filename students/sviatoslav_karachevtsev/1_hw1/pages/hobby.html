                        Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to
                        perform a task. Programming can be done using a variety of computer programming
                        languages, such as JavaScript, Python, and C++. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis,
                        generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the
                        implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as
                        coding). The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are
                        intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central
                        processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will
                        automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a
                        computer, often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus often requires
                        expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain,
                        specialized algorithms, and formal logic.</p>
                    <p>Tasks accompanying and related to programming include: testing, debugging, source code
                        maintenance, implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the
                        machine code of computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming process,
                        but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term
                        programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of code. Software
                        engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices. Reverse
                        engineering is a related process used by designers, analysts and programmers to understand and
                        re-create/re-implement.

                    <h3>Machine language</h3>
                    <p>Machine code was the language of early programs, written in the instruction set of the
                        particular machine, often in binary notation. Assembly languages were soon developed
                        that let the programmer specify instruction in a text format, (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with
                        abbreviations for each operation code and meaningful names for specifying addresses.
                        However, because an assembly language is little more than a different notation for a
                        machine language, any two machines with different instruction sets also have different
                        assembly languages.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Compiler languages</h3>
                    <p>High-level languages made the process of developing a program simpler and more
                        understandable, and less bound to the underlying hardware. The first compiler related
                        tool, the A-0 System, was developed in 1952 by Grace Hopper, who also coined the
                        term 'compiler'. FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level language to have a
                        functional implementation, came out in 1957, and many other languages were soon
                        developedâ€”in particular, COBOL aimed at commercial data processing, and Lisp for
                        computer research.</p>
                    <p>These compiled languages allow the programmer to write programs in terms that are
                        syntactically richer, and more capable of abstracting the code, making it easy to target
                        for varying machine instruction sets via compilation declarations and heuristics.
                        Compilers harnessed the power of computers to make programming easier by allowing
                        programmers to specify calculations by entering a formula using infix notation.</p>

                    <h3>Source code entry</h3>
                    <p>See also: Computer programming in the punched card era
                        Programs were mostly still entered using punched cards or paper tape. By the late 1960s,
                        data storage devices and computer terminals became inexpensive enough that programs
                        could be created by typing directly into the computers. Text editors were also developed
                        that allowed changes and corrections to be made much more easily than with punched
                        cards.

                    <h3>Alhorithmic complexity</h3>
                    <p>
                        The academic field and the engineering practice of computer programming are both largely
                        concerned with discovering and implementing the most efficient algorithms for a given class of
                        problems. For this purpose, algorithms are classified into orders using so-called Big O
                        notation, which expresses resource use, such as execution time or memory consumption, in terms
                        of the size of an input. Expert programmers are familiar with a variety of well-established
                        algorithms and their respective complexities and use this knowledge to choose algorithms that
                        are best suited to the circumstances.
                    </p>
                    <p>Chess algorithms as an example
                        "Programming a Computer for Playing Chess" was a 1950 paper that evaluated a "minimax" algorithm
                        that is part of the history of algorithmic complexity; a course on IBM's Deep Blue (chess
                        computer) is part of the computer science curriculum at Stanford University.

                        on language that has no foreign languages in the world...

                    <p><img src="../assets/images/soad.jpg" style="float: left;" width="350" alt=""></p>
                    <p>System of a Down (also known as SoaD or simply System) is an Armenian-American heavy metal band
                        formed in Glendale, California, in 1994. It currently consists of members Serj Tankian (lead
                        vocals, keyboards), Daron Malakian (guitar, vocals), Shavo Odadjian (bass, backing vocals), and
                        John Dolmayan (drums), who replaced original drummer Andy Khachaturian in 1997.</p>
                    <p>The band achieved commercial success with the release of five studio albums, three of which
                        debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200. System of a Down has been nominated for four
                        Grammy Awards and their song "B.Y.O.B." won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance in
                        2006. The band went on hiatus in 2006 and reunited in 2010. Other than two new songs in 2020
                        ("Protect the Land" and "Genocidal Humanoidz"), System of a Down has not released a
                        full-length record since the Mezmerize and Hypnotize albums in 2005. The band has sold over 40
                        million records worldwide, while two of their singles "Aerials" and "Hypnotize" reached number
                        one on Billboard's Alternative Songs chart.</p><br>
