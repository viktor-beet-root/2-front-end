            <h1 >CORE COMPONENTS</h1>
            <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs<br>
                 native capabilities. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the<br>
                 appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn more<br>about
                  React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React Native.</p>

            <h1 >REACT FUNDAMENTALS</h1>
            <p>
                React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most<br>of
                 React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.

                <li class="menu-iteam"><span>components. </span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures 
                    that<br>need names and a cafe to work in.
                </li>
                <li class="menu-iteam"><span>JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:
                    &lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am<br>your cat! &lt;/Text&gt;. The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer to learn
                     even more. Because JSX is<br>JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat,
                      name, and embedding it with curly<br>braces inside &lt;Text&gt;.</li>
                <li class="menu-iteam"><span>props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</li>
                <li class="menu-iteam"><span>state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render, state is like 
                    a<br>component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes from user<br>interaction. 
                    State gives your components memory!</li>

                <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText prop that takes a function to<br>be called every 
                  time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the text is<br>submitted.
                 </p>
                 <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language. In this new<br> language, every 
                 single word is written the same way:  So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçïüçïüçï".
