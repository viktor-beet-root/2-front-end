				<h2><sup>1</sup>Introduction</h2>
				<p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup
					instructions, they've moved to
					<spnan class="underline">their own section</spnan>. Continue reading for an introduction to the
					documentation, Native Components, React, and more!
				</p>

				<h2><sup>2</sup>Core Components</h2>
				<p> React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and
					the app platform‚Äôs native capabilities. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
					platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the
					appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You
					can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in React
					Native.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2><sup>3</sup>React Fundamentals</h2>
				React Native runs on
				<spnan class="underline">React</spnan>, a popular open source library for building user interfaces
				with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section
				can get you started or can serve as a refresher course.
				<span class="before-1"> We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</span>
				<p><span class="bolt">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
					examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
				</p>
				<p><span class="bolt">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
					elements inside JavaScript like so: &ltText&gtHello, I am your cat! &lt/Text&gt. The React docs have
					<spnan class="underline">a comprehensive guide to JSX </spnan> you can refer to learn even more.
					Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the
					cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside &ltText&gt.
				</p>
				<p><span class="bolt">+ props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
				</p>
				<p><span class="bolt">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure
					how components render, state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for
					handling data that changes over time
					or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!
				</p>

				<h2><sup>4</sup>Handling Text Input</h2>
				<p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText prop that
					takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a
					function to be called when the text
					is submitted.<span class="before-1"> For example, let's say that as the user types, you're
						translating their words into a
						different language.In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the
						sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated
						as "üçïüçïüçï".</span>
